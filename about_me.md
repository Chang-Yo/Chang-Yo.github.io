## About this Blog
I use the jekyll frame to set this Github Page themed in Minimal-Mistakes. Actually I didn't have any knowledges of Front-end Development at the beginning. However, with the strong assistance of Grok AI, I successfully deployed this site and adjust it to my favorate style. But I know it still has a lot of thing to learn to make this site better.

Generally I will collect my posted writings in this website as a backage. You can also see most of the posts in my **Zhihu** account [<i class="fa-brands fa-zhihu"></i>](https://www.zhihu.com/people/ChangYo).

If you have any interest about me, don't be afraid to contact me by the email!!
